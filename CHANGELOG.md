# FEATURE

- very basic text editor
- added basic keyboard support: `Ctrl+C,Ctrl+S`, `Enter`, `Backspace`, `Delete`, `Left,Right,Up,Down,Home,End,PgUp,PgDn`
- first working code - file are loaded lazily
- improved performance with mmap
- added option for read only
- added loading status - basically execute draw every second
- [experimental] added parallel indexing, use `PARALLEL_INDEXING=1` to enable
- fixed for too short characters - render give the whole row not according to window width anymore
- change frontend to tcell - much better
- improved structure, improve frontend
- added journal file (file is saved every 10 seconds or when buffer is full), use `DISABLE_JOURNAL=1` to disable
- add journal file replay, remove save function completely. if user wants to save a file, they has to use `telescope -r <input_file>`, the content will be written to stdout. `DISABLE_JOURNAL=1` no longer works
- rename journal to log
- fix a critical bug, printing using fmt.Fprintf doesn't escape `%` in code
- log is now use length-prefixed format so that the same file can be decoded using multiple format
- add function to print out human readable log format
- fixed exit condition - bufio.Writer is used, log will be written at the end of the program or every `LOG_FLUSH_INTERVAL_S=60` seconds
- fixed a bug that the UI keeps reading `mmap.ReaderAt` while is it already closed - just return `[]rune{}` if the file is closed
- decompose loading and editor logic
- improve robustness
- added undo redo with `Ctrl+U` and `Ctrl+R`, added keyboard shortcuts in help message
- added max history size
- fixed some bug when refactoring code, fix some rendering bug and improve usability
- fixed bug with replaying log
- remove exitting delay
- [experimental] added VISUAL/COMMAND/INSERT mode
- fixed VISUAL/COMMAND/INSERT mode sometimes hangs at start-up
- fixed bug when typing to the right end of the screen
- added default behavior when there is no input file specified
- added regexp search
- refactor - VISUAL/COMMAND/INSERT is now default
- rename VISUAL -> NORMAL
- added clipboard and selector, now has 4 modes: NORMAL COMMAND VISUAL INSERT
- fixed bug pgdn doesn't register selector
- optimize size of `core.text.Line` to a 16 bytes
- make clipboard just another persistent vector (`vector.Vector`) to save space and copying more efficient (but log still contains the whole text)
- `vector.Vector` -> `seq.Seq`
- added write to input file, when user use `:w` without specifying an output file, program will load input file into memory and write it back to the input file
- added commands: `:w` to overwrite the file, `:q! = :q`, `:wq = :w`
- added using `b` or `g` to go to beg of file, `e` or `G` to go to end of file 
- added basic mouse support: scroll up, scroll down, left click
- update interface
- added `gotoAndFixWithoutLock` to absolute position
- improve robustness, now, interrupt like `SIGINT` (`Ctrl+C`) will preserve the log to restore later
- fixed bug writing to not exist file

# TODO

- added cache for file loading
- optimize size of `core.text.Line` to a single `int64`
- make binary serializer works with delete lines and insert lines
- add compressed log: compress multiple `type` into a single `type` (`Text []rune` instead of `Rune rune`)
